            I am transitioning from the military and starting a new career journey in tech. I previously worked as a cop and wanted to do something with my problem solving skills in a creative and unique way.

         <h3>My Personal Life</h3>
         <p id="personalLife">
            I was born and raised in California.  After some trial and error, I started my military career in April 2019 at JBSA Lackland,TX. <br>
            I got married to my husband, Bandit, on August 10, 2019, while still attending job training.<br>
            My first duty station was Moody AFB, GA, which is the furthest I've ever been from home.<br>
            We had our two year old, Bluey, on October 5, 2020.
